### ABSTRACT
Co-speech gestures, gestures that accompany speech, play an important role in human communication. Automatic co-speech gesture generation is thus a key enabling technology for embodied conversational agents (ECAs), since humans expect ECAs to be capable of multi-modal communication. Research into gesture generation is rapidly gravitating towards data-driven methods. Unfortunately, individual research efforts in the field are difficult to compare: there are no established benchmarks, and each study tends to use its own dataset, motion visualisation, and evaluation methodology. To address this situation, we launched the GENEA Challenge, a gesture-generation challenge wherein participating teams built automatic gesture-generation systems on a common dataset, and the resulting systems were evaluated in parallel in a large, crowdsourced user study using the same motion-rendering pipeline. Since differences in evaluation outcomes between systems now are solely attributable to differences between the motion-generation methods, this enables benchmarking recent approaches against one another in order to get a better impression of the state of the art in the field. This paper reports on the purpose, design, results, and implications of our challenge.

* - We discovered an issue with the velocity loss implementation used for our experiments. The bug was fixed in [this commit](https://github.com/Svito-zar/gesticulator/commit/11642221751593e801790907b0dd5247d88b6468). The experimental results involving velocity loss were hence not correct and should be disregarded. We are going to conduct a new experiment with the proper velocity loss implementation and will share the results on this project webpage.
* - We have identified a minor error in our paper concerning the results of PCA. The PCA we used had 12 components (as stated), but these accounted for 92% of the variation on the training set, and not 95% like the paper published at ICMI suggests. The error was corrected in online postprints of the article.
