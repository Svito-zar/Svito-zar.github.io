I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning for Social Robotics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. My main supervisor is [Hedvig Kjellstr√∂m](http://www.csc.kth.se/~hedvig/) and co-supervisors are [Gustav Eje Henter](https://people.kth.se/~ghe/) and [Iolanda Leite](https://iolandaleite.com/).

My research is on generative models of non-verbal behavior, such as hand gestures and facial expressions. You can watch me explaining it [here](https://youtu.be/AS5VorjTwcg). My latest project can be found on this [page](https://svito-zar.github.io/audio2gestures/).

I am working in the HealthTech project [EACare](http://www.csc.kth.se/cvap/EACare/), where we aim to develop a robot system to detect early signs of Dementia from the communicative behavior. My part is non-verbal behavior generation.

### **News**
* <strong> April 2020: </strong> The CFP for our IVA'20 [Workshop](https://genea-workshop.github.io/2020/) on Generation and Evaluation of Non-verbal Behaviour for Embodied Agents is [out](https://easychair.org/cfp/GENEA_Workshop_2020). As part of this workshop we organize Gesture Generation Challenge!
* <strong>Feb 2020:</strong> Our paper *Style-Controllable Speech-Driven Gesture Synthesis Using Normalising Flows* was accepted to Eurographics 2020.
* <strong>Jan 2020:</strong> Sifan Jiang started his master thesis with me. He will be extending my gesture generation model to humanoid robot NAO.
* <strong>November 2019:</strong> [Talk](https://youtu.be/AS5VorjTwcg) on general direction of my research.
* <strong>October 2019:</strong> Master students wanted for a master thesis project on gesture generation for a humanoid robot.
* <strong>September 2019</strong> Talk on [How to make your agent gesture in a natural way](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/events/how-to-make-your-agent-gesture-in-a-natural-way) at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems: [Perceiving Systems](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de) Department in Tuebingen.
* <strong>August 2019:</strong> Our gesture generation model was applied to a new dataset. Now it can gesticulate in both Japanese and English. Check out a short [demo video](https://youtu.be/tQLVyTVtsSU) and our [code](https://github.com/Svito-zar/speech-driven-hand-gesture-generation-demo) with a pre-trained model.
* <strong>June 2019:</strong> Our two papers were accepted for [ICDL-EPIROB 2019 Workshop](https://nicolas-navarro-guerrero.gitlab.io/workshop-non-verbal-human-robot-interactions-icdl-epirob-2019/) on Naturalistic Non-Verbal and Affective Human-Robot Interactions.
* <strong>May 2019:</strong> Talk on my research at the [Pint Of Science](http://pintofscience.se/) in Stockholm.
* <strong>April 2019:</strong> Our paper [Analyzing input and output representations for speech-driven gesture generation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331645229_Analyzing_Input_and_Output_Representations_for_Speech-Driven_Gesture_Generation) was accepter to [IVA 2019](https://iva2019.sciencesconf.org/) for oral presentation. (24% acceptance rate)
* <strong>Jan 2019:</strong> Our paper [On the importance of representations for speech-driven gesture generation](http://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2019/pdfs/p2072.pdf) was accepted at [AAMAS 2019](http://aamas2019.encs.concordia.ca/) for poster presentation.
* <strong>Oct 2018:</strong> My [project proposal](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328032360_Data_Driven_Non-Verbal_Behavior_Generation_for_Humanoid_Robots) was published ICMI Doctoral Consortium 2018.
* <strong>April 2018:</strong> Joined Social Robotics Sweden ([SoRoS](https://soros-community.github.io/)) community.
* <strong>June 2017:</strong> We had a [poster](https://www.csc.kth.se/~hedvig/publications/ssdl_17.pdf) at The First Swedish Symposium on Deep Learning (SSDL).
