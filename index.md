I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning for Social Robotics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.

My research is on generative models of non-verbal behavior, such as hand gestures and facial expressions.

I am working at [EACare](http://www.csc.kth.se/cvap/EACare/) project, where we aim to develop a robot head with communicative skills capable of interacting with elderly people at their convenience.
