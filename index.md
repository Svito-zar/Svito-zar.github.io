I am a Ph.D. student in Machine Learning for Social Robotics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.

My research is on generative models of non-verbal behavior, such as hand gestures and facial expressions.

I am working in the [EACare](http://www.csc.kth.se/cvap/EACare/) project, where we aim to develop a robot system to detect early signs of Dementia from the communicative behavior.

### **News**

* <strong>October 2019:</strong> I have a [master thesis project](../projects/MasterThesisRobotGestureGeneration.pdf) on gesture generation for a humanoid robot.
* <strong>September 2019</strong> I gave a talk on [How to make your agent gesture in a natural way](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/events/how-to-make-your-agent-gesture-in-a-natural-way) at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems: [Perceiving Systems](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de) Department in Tuebingen
* <strong>August 2019:</strong> We have applied our gesture generation model to a new dataset, which is in English. Check our a short [demo video](https://youtu.be/tQLVyTVtsSU) and our [code](https://github.com/Svito-zar/speech-driven-hand-gesture-generation-demo) with a pre-trained model
* <strong>June 2019:</strong> Our two papers were accepted for [ICDL-EPIROB 2019 Workshop](https://nicolas-navarro-guerrero.gitlab.io/workshop-non-verbal-human-robot-interactions-icdl-epirob-2019/) on Naturalistic Non-Verbal and Affective Human-Robot Interactions
* <strong>May 2019:</strong> Gave a talk on my research at the [Pint Of Science](http://pintofscience.se/) in Stockholm

(24% acceptance rate)
* <strong>Jan 2019:</strong> Our paper [On the importance of representations for speech-driven gesture generation](http://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2019/pdfs/p2072.pdf) was accepted at [AAMAS 2019](http://aamas2019.encs.concordia.ca/) for poster presentation.
* <strong>Oct 2018:</strong> My [project proposal](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328032360_Data_Driven_Non-Verbal_Behavior_Generation_for_Humanoid_Robots) was published ICMI Doctoral Consortium 2018.
* <strong>April 2018:</strong> I become a member of a Social Robotics Sweden ([SoRoS](https://soros-community.github.io/)) community.
* <strong>June 2017:</strong> We had a [poster](https://www.csc.kth.se/~hedvig/publications/ssdl_17.pdf) at The First Swedish Symposium on Deep Learning (SSDL).
