Ylva Ferstl and Rachell McDonnell collected Trinity Speech Gesture [dataset](https://trinityspeechgesture.scss.tcd.ie/) as a part of their [work](https://www.scss.tcd.ie/Rachel.McDonnell/papers/IVA2018b.pdf) on gesture generation.
This dataset may be used for non-commercial purposes only. 


I have cleaned this dataset and converted it from FBX to BVH format.
The resulting gestures are [online](https://kth.box.com/s/eug26hckfiehvygkrsrbwv7rk89hg51a) is the  <br>
The corresponding audio recordings are also [available](https://kth.box.com/s/fb71mmw1u3y8quh266bmaii804jpse8j).
